/**
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!

Example :
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
